## Introduction

Nuxt is a Vue metaframework that aims to make web development intuitive and performant while keeping great developer experience in mind. The original version, created by [Sébastien Chopin in October 2016](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/commit/0072ed31da6ce39d21046e05898f956cff190390), was built to emulate the features of Next.js (such as file-system based routing, server-side rendering, and API routes) but with Vue instead of React. Version 3 has been [over a year in the making](https://nuxtjs.org/announcements/nuxt3-beta/).

> We are excited to open source Nuxt 3 after more than a year of intense development. On top of supporting Vue 3 and Vite, Nuxt 3 contains a new server engine, unlocking new full-stack capabilities to Nuxt server and beyond.
> 
> [Introducing Nuxt 3 Beta](https://nuxtjs.org/announcements/nuxt3-beta/)

Nuxt 3 is composed of the following [core packages](https://github.com/nuxt/framework/tree/main/packages):

|Package |Purpose  |
|---------|----------|
|[nuxt3](https://github.com/nuxt/framework/tree/main/packages/nuxt3)|Core Engine|
|[nuxi](https://github.com/nuxt/framework/tree/main/packages/nuxi)|Command line interface|
|[vite-builder](https://github.com/nuxt/framework/tree/main/packages/vite) or [webpack-builder](https://github.com/nuxt/framework/tree/main/packages/webpack)|Bundlers|
|[nitro](https://github.com/nuxt/framework/tree/main/packages/nitro)|Server engine|
|[kit](https://github.com/nuxt/framework/tree/main/packages/kit)|Development kit|
|[bridge](https://github.com/nuxt/framework/tree/main/packages/bridge)|Nuxt 2 Bridge|

Together these packages provide a selection of libraries for managing many common concerns for developers building on the web today such as:

|Library|Common Concern|
|-------------------|--------|
|[Vue.js](https://v3.vuejs.org)|JavaScript framework for reactivity and components|
|[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) or [Webpack 5](https://webpack.js.org/)|Bundler for hot module replacement in dev and bundling for production|
|[esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io)|Transpiler for supporting legacy browsers while still using current JavaScript syntax|
|[h3](https://github.com/unjs/h3)|Server that can serve your application in development and support [server-side rendering](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/ssr/introduction.html#what-is-server-side-rendering-ssr) or API routes|
|[vue-router](https://next.router.vuejs.org)|Routing library to handle client-side navigation|

In addition to curating and integrating these tools, Nuxt also provides directory structure conventions for managing pages and components.

### Migrating from Nuxt 2 to Nuxt 3

> Note: If you don't have a Nuxt 2 project, skip ahead to the section, "[Create Nuxt 3 Project from Scratch](#heading-create-nuxt-3-project-from-scratch)."

The team has created two [migration guides](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/getting-started/migration) and tooling in the form of [Nuxt Bridge](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/bridge/overview/) to make migrating as smooth as possible . If you have an existing Nuxt 2 project, the team **strongly recommends** you begin by using Nuxt Bridge to experiment with new features while avoiding breaking changes. Bridge is a forward-compatibility layer that allows you to experience new Nuxt 3 features by installing and enabling a Nuxt module.

All Nuxt 2 modules should be forward compatible with Nuxt 3 as long as they migrate to bridge or if they are already following guidelines. All (upcoming) modules made with `@nuxt/kit` should be backward compatible with Nuxt 2 projects (even without bridge) as long as they are not depending on a Nuxt 3 / Bridge-only feature. Since Nuxt 3 natively supports TypeScript and ECMAScript Modules, it is useful to avoid CommonJS syntax such as `__dirname`, `__filename`, `require()`, and `module.exports` as much as possible.

### Try Online Example

We will be building a Nuxt application from scratch. However, you can start playing with Nuxt 3 online in your browser on either [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/nuxt/starter/tree/v3-stackblitz) or [CodeSandBox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/nuxt/starter/tree/v3-codesandbox). All the code for the project in this article can be found [on my GitHub](https://github.com/ajcwebdev/ajcwebdev-nuxt3).

## Create Nuxt 3 Project from Scratch

Create a blank new directory and initialize a `package.json` file for defining our scripts and dependencies.

```bash
mkdir ajcwebdev-nuxt3
cd ajcwebdev-nuxt3
yarn init -y
yarn add -D nuxt@3.0.0-rc.3 vercel
```

> Version is current as of June 10, 2022, check the [release schedule on GitHub](https://github.com/nuxt/framework/releases) for most recent version.

The project will start with only two additional files:
* `app.vue` to display our Vue application
* `.gitignore` to avoid accidentally committing stuff that shouldn't be committed

```bash
echo > app.vue
echo 'node_modules\n.DS_Store\n*.log\n.nuxt\nnuxt.d.ts\n.output' > .gitignore
```

We will create a directory for `pages` and an `api` later on.

### App Component

`app.vue` is the main component in your Nuxt 3 applications. This means that anything you add to this file (such as JavaScript or CSS) will be global and included in every page.

```html
<!-- app.vue -->

<template>
  <div>
    <h2>ajcwebdev-nuxt3</h2>
  </div>
</template>
```

With Nuxt 3, the `pages` directory is optional. If a `pages` directory is not present, Nuxt won't include the [vue-router](https://next.router.vuejs.org/) dependency. This is useful when working on single landing pages or other applications that don't not need routing.

### Project Scripts

In your `package.json`, add the following scripts (`build`, `dev`, `generate`, and `preview`).

```json
{
  "name": "ajcwebdev-nuxt3",
  "license": "MIT",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "nuxt build",
    "dev": "nuxt dev",
    "generate": "nuxt generate",
    "preview": "nuxt preview"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nuxt": "3.0.0-rc.3",
    "vercel": "^25.1.0"
  }
}
```

Nuxi is the new CLI for Nuxt 3 and has four main commands:
1. `dev` - Start development server
2. `build` - Make production assets
3. `generate` - Generate static site
4. `preview` - Preview production build

### Start Development Server

The `yarn dev` command starts your Nuxt app in development mode and includes hot module replacement. Include the `--open` flag to automatically open the browser after starting up.

```bash
yarn dev
```

The CLI will display links to the running application and performance metrics.

```
Nuxt CLI v3.0.0-rc.3

  > Local:    http://localhost:3000/
  > Network:  http://192.168.1.78:3000/

ℹ Vite client warmed up in 288ms
ℹ Vite server warmed up in 50ms
✔ Vite server built in 269ms
✔ Nitro built in 171 ms
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your application.

![01-ajcwebdev-nuxt3-localhost-3000](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9oc49oolv9d31ljml352.png)

### Build for Production

The `yarn build` command builds your Nuxt application for production. It creates a `.output` directory with your application, server, and dependencies ready to be deployed.

```bash
yarn build
```

Nitro produces a standalone server dist that is independent of `node_modules`. The output is combined with both runtime code to run your Nuxt server in any environment and serve you static files.

### Pages Directory

The `pages` directory is optional, meaning that if you only use `app.vue`, `vue-router` won't be included, reducing your application bundle size. However, if you do include it, Nuxt will automatically integrate [Vue Router](https://next.router.vuejs.org/) and map the files in the `pages` directory into the routes of your application. Delete `app.vue` and create two files in a new `pages` directory.

```bash
rm -rf app.vue
mkdir pages
echo > pages/about.vue
echo > pages/index.vue
```

Include the previous home page's content in `pages/index.vue`.

```html
<!-- pages/index.vue -->

<template>
  <div>
    <h2>ajcwebdev-nuxt3</h2>
  </div>
</template>
```

We also created `pages/about.vue` for an about page. Include the following code to make sure that people know stuff about your things.

```html
<!-- pages/about.vue -->

<template>
  <div>
    <h2>This page tells you stuff about things!</h2>
  </div>
</template>
```

Open [localhost:3000/about](http://localhost:3000/about) to see the about page.

![02-about-page-localhost-3000](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lyngyw7ae27x213gfu4f.png)

## Server Engine

Nuxt 3 is powered by a new server engine called Nitro. Nitro is used in development and production. It includes cross-platform support for Node.js, browser engines, service workers and serverless. It enables API routes, code-splitting, async-loaded chunks, and hybrid static/serverless modes. The Server API endpoints and middleware internally use [h3](https://github.com/unjs/h3).

* Handlers can directly return objects/arrays for JSON response
* Handlers can return promises that are awaited (`res.end()` and `next()` are also supported)
* Helper functions include body parsing, cookie handling, redirects, and headers

Nitro allows 'direct' calling of routes via the globally-available `$fetch` helper. If run on the browser it will make an API call to the server. But it will call the relevant function if run on the server and save an additional API call. The `$fetch` API uses [ohmyfetch](https://github.com/unjs/ohmyfetch) to:

* Automatically parse JSON responses (with access to raw responses if needed)
* Automatically handle request body and params with correct `Content-Type` headers added

### Server Directory for API Routes

The `server` directory contains API endpoints and server middleware for your project. It is used to create any backend logic for your Nuxt application. Nuxt will automatically read in any files in the `~/server/api` directory to create API endpoints. Each file should export a default function that handles API requests.

```bash
mkdir -p server/api
echo > server/api/index.js
```

Add the following code to `index.js`.

```js
// server/api/index.js

export default (req, res) => (`
  <h2>Hello from Nuxt 3</h2>
`)
```

Open [localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api) and make sure not to include a trailing slash or it will error out.

![03-hello-api-route-localhost-3000](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9g8nobz0clkvvmhw8e5o.png)

We could also flesh out this route into a full HTML document.

```js
// server/api/index.js

export default (req, res) => (`
  <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <meta name="description" content="A minimal HTML website served on a Nuxt API route.">
      <title>Nuxt 3 API Route</title>
    </head>
    
    <body>
      <header>
        <h2>Hello from Nuxt 3</h2>
      </header>
      <footer>ajcwebdev '22</footer>
    </body>
  </html>
`)
```
