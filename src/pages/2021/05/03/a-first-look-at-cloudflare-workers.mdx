## Introduction

A [Cloudflare Worker](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflare-workers/) contains JavaScript that runs on Cloudflare's edge servers. A [Cloudflare Service Worker](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-workers-unleashed/) is a worker written against the Service Worker API and specifically handles HTTP traffic. Cloudflare Workers derive their name from Web Workers, specifically Service Workers.

The [Service Worker API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) is a W3C standard API for scripts that run in the background in a web browser and intercept HTTP requests. Cloudflare Workers are written against the same standard API but run on Cloudflare's edge network instead of the browser.

## Install the Wrangler CLI

[`wrangler`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler) is an officially supported CLI tool for [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/).

### Install Wrangler with Volta

[Volta.sh](https://volta.sh/) is a JavaScript tool manager that can be used for global installs and switching between different versions of Node. It can be installed with the following `curl` command (and if you are not using `zsh` then change the end of the command to `bash`).

```bash
curl https://get.volta.sh | zsh
volta install node
npm install -g wrangler
```

Visit the [Workers documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/get-started/) if you encounter issues while trying to install Wrangler. Check the version number with the following command:

```bash
wrangler --version
```

> Note: In this article I used version `2.0.8`.

### Login to Cloudflare Account

```bash
wrangler login
```

## Create Workers Project

You can generate a boilerplate Workers project with [`wrangler init`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#init), but in this example we'll start from a blank directory.

```bash
mkdir ajcwebdev-workers
cd ajcwebdev-workers
```

Initialize a `package.json` and install the Wrangler dependency.

```bash
yarn init -y
yarn add -D wrangler
```

A Workers project can be very concise and the only files required are `index.js` and `wrangler.toml`.

```bash
echo > index.js
echo > wrangler.toml
echo 'node_modules\n.DS_Store' > .gitignore
```

### Wrangler Configuration File

`wrangler` uses a [`wrangler.toml` configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/) to customize the development and publishing setup for a Worker. Add the following to `wrangler.toml` and include your own project name. 

```toml
# wrangler.toml

name = "ajcwebdev-workers"
main = "index.js"
compatibility_date = "2022-06-09"
```

This includes three configuration options:

* `name` sets the name of your Worker.
* `main` sets the entrypoint/path to the file that will be executed.
* `compatibility_date` is used to determine which version of the Workers runtime is used.

### Workers Script

`index.js` will contain the content of the Workers script. The script will notify the visitor of your website that you nailed it. Add the following:

```javascript
// index.js

export default {
  async fetch(request) {
    return new Response("Nailed it!", {
      headers: { 'X-Awesomeness': '9000' }
    })
  }
}
```

We don't add header `X-Awesomeness` because we need to, we add it because we can. 

### Test Worker Locally

Start a local server for developing your Worker with [`wrangler dev`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev).

```bash
wrangler dev
```

Open [localhost:8787/](http://localhost:8787/) to see the response or use `curl` to send an HTTP GET method.

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8787/"
```

> Note: Add `-i` option to see header information.

## Deploy Worker to Cloudflare

`wrangler publish` publishes your Worker to Cloudflare.

```bash
wrangler publish
```

Output:

```
Uploaded ajcwebdev-workers (0.76 sec)
Published ajcwebdev-workers (0.20 sec)
  ajcwebdev-workers.anthonycampolo.workers.dev
```

```bash
curl "https://ajcwebdev-workers.anthonycampolo.workers.dev"
```

Alternatively, you can open up your favorite API client and make a GET request to your endpoint.

You can also visit the endpoint with your browser of choice.

Open up the Network tab to see how much more awesome your response headers are.
