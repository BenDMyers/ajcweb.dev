## Introduction

AWS Lambda is a powerful computing model because it gives developers a known execution environment with a specific runtime that accepts and runs arbitrary code. But this also causes problems if you have a use case outside the environments predetermined by AWS.

To address this issue, AWS introduced [Lambda Layers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html). Layers allow packaging `.zip` files with the libraries and dependencies needed for the Lambda functions. But [Lambda Layers still have limitations](https://lumigo.io/blog/lambda-layers-when-to-use-it/) including testing, static analysis, and versioning. In December 2020, [AWS Lambda released Docker container support](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-for-aws-lambda-container-image-support/).

Shortly after the announcement, the Serverless framework created the [following example](https://www.serverless.com/blog/container-support-for-lambda) to demonstrate how to use the new feature. This blog post will break down that example by building the project from scratch. All the code for this project can be found [on my GitHub](https://github.com/ajcwebdev/ajcwebdev-docker-lambda).

## Create Project

Start by creating a blank directory and initialize a `package.json` file.

```bash
mkdir ajcwebdev-docker-lambda
cd ajcwebdev-docker-lambda
yarn init -y
```

Instead of globally installing the Serverless CLI, we will install the `serverless` package as a local dependency in our project.

```bash
yarn add -D serverless
```

As a consequence, to execute `sls` commands we must prefix the commands with `yarn` or `npx`. You can refer to the [official Serverless documentation](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started) if you prefer to install the CLI globally. After installing the `serverless` dependency, create the following files:
* `app.js` for our Lambda function code that will return a simple message when invoked.
* `Dockerfile` for defining the dependencies, files, and commands needed to build and run our container image.
* `serverless.yml` for defining our [AWS resources in code](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/services#serverlessyml) which will be translated into a single [CloudFormation template that will generate a CloudFormation stack](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/resources).
* `.gitignore` so we do not commit our `node_modules` or the `.serverless` directory that contains our build artifacts and is generated when we deploy our project to AWS.

```bash
touch app.js Dockerfile serverless.yml
echo 'node_modules\n.DS_Store\n.serverless' > .gitignore
```

## Serverless YAML Configuration File

The Serverless Framework lets you define a Dockerfile and point at it in the `serverless.yml` configuration file. The Framework makes sure the container is available in ECR and setup with configuration for Lambda.

```yaml
service: ajcwebdev-docker-lambda
frameworkVersion: '3'
```

### AWS Provider

We select the [AWS `provider`](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws) and include an `ecr` section for defining images that will be built locally and uploaded to ECR. The entire packaging process occurs in the context of the container. AWS uses your Docker configuration to build, optimize and prepare your container for use in Lambda.

> *Note: If you are using an Apple M1, you will need to uncomment out the line that specifies `arm64` for the `architecture` in the `provider` property.*

```yaml
provider:
  name: aws
  # architecture: arm64
  ecr:
    images:
      appimage:
        path: ./
```

### Functions Property

The `functions` property tells the framework the image reference name (`appimage`) that is used elsewhere in our configuration. The location of the content of the Docker image is set with the `path` property. A `Dockerfile` of some type should reside in the specified folder containing the executable code for our function.

```yaml
functions:
  hello:
    image:
      name: appimage
```

We use the same value for `image.name` as we do for the image we defined, `appimage`. It can be named anything as long as the same value is referenced. Here is our complete `serverless.yml` file:

```yaml
# serverless.yml

service: ajcwebdev-docker-lambda
frameworkVersion: '3'
provider:
  name: aws
  # architecture: arm64
  ecr:
    images:
      appimage:
        path: ./
functions:
  hello:
    image:
      name: appimage
```

## Dockerfile

The easiest way to setup a Lambda ready Docker image is to use base images provided by AWS. The [AWS ECR Gallery](https://gallery.ecr.aws/) contains a list of all available images. We are using the Node [v14 image](https://gallery.ecr.aws/lambda/nodejs).

```docker
# Dockerfile

FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/nodejs:14

COPY app.js ./

CMD ["app.handler"]
```

The `CMD` property defines a file called `app.js` with a function called `handler`. In the next section we will define the `handler` function and add the necessary code to our project. This would need to be modified if we changed the `app.js` file name or exported our function handler as something other than `handler`.

## Function Handler

We will now include the code that will be executed by our handler when the function is invoked. Add the following code to the `app.js` file in the root of the project:

```js
// app.js

'use strict'

module.exports.handler = async (event) => {
  const message = `Cause I don't want a server, but I do still want a container`
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify(
      { message }, null, 2
    ),
  }
}
```

`app.js` returns a JSON object containing a message clarifying exactly why anyone would ever want to do this in the first place.

## Deploy to AWS

We are now able to generate our container, deploy it to ECR, and execute our function.

### Configure AWS Credentials

First, you will need to [set your AWS credentials](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/#using-aws-access-keys) with the [`sls config credentials`](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/config-credentials) command. This step can be skipped if you are using a global install of the CLI that is already configured with your credentials.

```bash
yarn sls config credentials \
  --provider aws \
  --key YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID \
  --secret YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

### Run Serverless Deploy Command

In order to build images locally and push them to ECR, you need to have Docker [installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and running on your local machine.

```bash
yarn sls deploy
```

The `sls deploy` command deploys your entire service via CloudFormation. After the deployment finishes you will be provided the information for your service.

```
Deploying ajcwebdev-docker-lambda to stage dev (us-east-1)

âœ” Service deployed to stack ajcwebdev-docker-lambda-dev (183s)

functions:
  hello: ajcwebdev-docker-lambda-dev-hello
```

### Invoke the Deployed Function

The `sls invoke` command invokes a deployed function. It allows sending event data to the function, reading logs, and displaying other important information about the function invocation.

```bash
yarn sls invoke --function hello
```

If your function/container was configured and deployed correctly then you will receive the following message:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "body": "{\n  \"message\": \"Cause I don't want a server, but I do still want a container\"\n}"
}
```
