## Introduction

I discovered a cool little trick while source diving through [Scott Mathson](https://scottmathson.com/)'s web site. With just a couple lines of JavaScript you can create a message that displays a different greeting depending on the day of the week.

### Create a Script with a Weekday Array

Create a `<script>` tag with `type` of `text/javascript`. Define a variable called `weekday` with a different greeting set to each index.

```html
<script type="text/javascript">

  var weekday = new Array(7)

  weekday[0] = "spectacular Sunday"
  weekday[1] = "marvelous Monday"
  weekday[2] = "terrific Tuesday"
  weekday[3] = "wonderful Wednesday"
  weekday[4] = "totally cool Thursday"
  weekday[5] = "fantastic Friday"
  weekday[6] = "sweet Saturday"

</script>
```

### Set Weekday Value to the Current Date

Also inside the script tag, create a variable called `currentDate` set with the [`Date()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) object and then set the current day to `weekdayValue`.

```javascript
var currentDate = new Date()
weekdayValue = currentDate.getDay()
```

### Write to the Document

Use the [Document.write()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/write) method to write a string of text to the document with paragraph tags containing the weekday value..

```javascript
document.write(
  '<p>Have a ' + weekday[weekdayValue] + '!</p>'
)
```

### Noscript Fallback

Lastly, you'll want to include a `<noscript>` tag in case the user has JavaScript turned off in their browser.

```html
<noscript>
  <p>Have a great day!</p>
</noscript>
```

## Full Script

```html
<script type="text/javascript">

  var weekday = new Array(7)

  weekday[0] = "spectacular Sunday"
  weekday[1] = "marvelous Monday"
  weekday[2] = "terrific Tuesday"
  weekday[3] = "wonderful Wednesday"
  weekday[4] = "totally cool Thursday"
  weekday[5] = "fantastic Friday"
  weekday[6] = "sweet Saturday"

  var currentDate = new Date()
  weekdayValue = currentDate.getDay()

  document.write(
    '<p>Have a ' + weekday[weekdayValue] + '!</p>'
  )
</script>

<noscript>
  <p>Have a great day!</p>
</noscript>
```
