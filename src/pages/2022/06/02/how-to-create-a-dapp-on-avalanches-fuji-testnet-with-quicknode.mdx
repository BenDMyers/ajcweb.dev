## Introduction

[Avalanche](https://www.avax.network/) is an open-source, proof-of-stake blockchain with smart contract functionality that uses the Snow family of consensus protocols. The Avalanche Primary Network consists of [3 built-in blockchains](https://docs.avax.network/overview/getting-started/avalanche-platform) that are validated and secured by the Primary Network:

* [Exchange Chain (X-Chain)](https://docs.avax.network/overview/getting-started/avalanche-platform/#exchange-chain-x-chain) - Acts as a decentralized platform for creating and trading digital smart assets like AVAX. These assets represent a real-world resource with a set of rules that govern its behavior. The X-Chain is an instance of the Avalanche Virtual Machine (AVM).
* [Platform Chain (P-Chain)](https://docs.avax.network/overview/getting-started/avalanche-platform/#platform-chain-p-chain) - Coordinates validators, keeps track of active subnets, and enables the creation of new subnets as the metadata blockchain on Avalanche. The P-Chain implements the [Snowman consensus protocol](https://docs.avax.network/#snowman-consensus-protocol).
* [Contract Chain (C-Chain)](https://docs.avax.network/overview/getting-started/avalanche-platform/#contract-chain-c-chain) - Allows for the creation of smart contracts using the [C-Chain's API](https://docs.avax.network/apis/avalanchego/apis/c-chain).

Avalanche's consensus mechanism aims to enable developing applications that are faster, cheaper, and more energy efficient than competing chains. Avalanche is one of several new Layer 1 blockchains that are competing to draw Ethereum developers. Compared to non-EVM based blockchains, Ethereum developers will have a simpler onboarding experience using Avalanche's smart contracts since they can be written in Solidity.

![01-avalanche-primary-network-diagram](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1652371334021/gR7DyKNei.png)

In this guide, we'll walk through setting up a wallet for the Avalanche network, deploy a smart contract, and connect a frontend application to that contract. By the end, you'll have a dApp connected to the Avalanche Fuji testnet.

### What You Will Do

* Configure your Coinbase wallet for the Avalanche network
* Deploy a smart contract written in Solidity to the Fuji Testnet
* Create a React frontend application that reads and writes to the contract

### What You Will Need

* [Node v16](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet)
* Knowledge of JavaScript, [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
* [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)

## Set Up Avalanche API on QuickNode

To build on Avalanche, you'll need an API endpoint that can communicate with the network. While it is possible to deploy, host, and manage your own nodes, this guide will use QuickNode.

QuickNode manages the blockchain infrastructure for us by providing an endpoint that's already configured for a given blockchain. You can sign up for a free, 7-day trial after creating an account by [filling in the form on the homepage](https://www.quicknode.com/).

### Create an Endpoint

Once you've created an account, you should see the following screen.
  
![02-create-an-endpoint-on-quicknode](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1652250042612/zN6MfjTcW.png)
  
Click the "Create an endpoint" button and select the "Avalanche" chain.

![03-choose-a-chain-and-network](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1652250176774/mzXz9SRZc.png)

We'll be working with the Fuji Testnet for this guide, so go ahead and select the "Fuji Testnet" for the network.

![04-select-your-avalanche-network](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1652250226185/bPVQkxHnd.png)

You will then have the option to set up any additional functionality, including Archive Mode or Trace Mode. You can skip those for this guide and complete the setup by submitting your payment information. Your card will not be charged for the first seven days.

![05-avalanche-endpoint-on-quicknode](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1652250296162/1i9j5398_.png)

## Configure Coinbase Wallet for Avalanche

You can create an Avalanche Wallet online at [wallet.avax.network](https://wallet.avax.network/) or configure an existing wallet that allows connecting to RPC endpoints. We will be using Coinbase Wallet in this tutorial which you can download [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/coinbase-wallet-extension/hnfanknocfeofbddgcijnmhnfnkdnaad).

### Add the Avalanche Network

Open your Coinbase Wallet and enable Developer Mode in the **Settings** tab.

![06-coinbase-wallet-developer-mode-setting](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1654499547446/ugrIDik5k.png)

In the same tab, check the available networks by selecting "Default network" and selecting "Avalanche Fuji" under **testnets**.

![07-set-avalanche-fuji-to-default-network](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1654499722117/7FzZDF0PX.png)

### Fuji Testnet Faucet

To interact with Fuji, we need to have AVAX in your wallet. Navigate to the assets tab and copy the Ethereum address to your clipboard.

![08-get-ethereum-address-in-assets](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1654499991117/yRRfaZtFV.png)

Like the Ropsten faucet on Ethereum, Avalanche has the [Fuji Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.avax-test.network/). Include your wallet address and click "Request 2 AVAX."

![09-fuji-testnet-faucet](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1652248145323/ZJZukmVNw.png)

Return to your wallet. You should now have 2 Testnet AVAX tokens.

![10-coinbase-wallet-with-testnet-avax](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1654500129191/pzvO2NpMp.png)

## Create a New Project

Vite is a modern, frontend build tool and open source project that offers an alternative to Webpack. You can use it to create a new project with the Vite React template that is very similar to the type of project created by [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/). We'll use Vite to connect to the smart contract deployed later in the tutorial.

Open a Terminal window and run the following commands to generate a boilerplate project:

```bash
yarn create vite getting-started-with-avalanche --template react
cd getting-started-with-avalanche
```

After generating the boilerplate app, install dependencies for `hardhat`, `ethers`, `@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers`, and `dotenv` to manage environment variables:

```bash
yarn add -D dotenv hardhat ethers @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers
```

Create the directories and files for your smart contract, Hardhat deployment script, and Hardhat configuration:

```bash
mkdir contracts scripts
echo > contracts/HelloWorld.sol
echo > scripts/deploy.js
echo > hardhat.config.js
```

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project to hold environment variables for our endpoint URL, private key, and contract address.

```bash
echo 'QUICKNODE_URL=\nPRIVATE_KEY=\nVITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=' > .env
```

Add `.env` to `.gitignore` so you do not commit any private information.

```bash
echo '.env' >> .gitignore
```

### Create a Hello World Solidity Contract

Next, we'll add a boilerplate smart contract, `HelloWorld`, to deploy to Avalanche. The contract will have a string variable called `helloMessage`, a function to read the message, and a function to change the message.

Open your project with a code editor and add the following code to `contracts/HelloWorld.sol`:

```solidity
// contracts/HelloWorld.sol

// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.6;

import "hardhat/console.sol";

contract HelloWorld {
  string private helloMessage;

  constructor(string memory _helloMessage) {
    console.log(_helloMessage);
    helloMessage = _helloMessage;
  }

  function hello() public view returns (string memory) {
    return helloMessage;
  }

  function setHello(string memory _helloMessage) public {
    console.log("Changing helloMessage from '%s' to '%s'", helloMessage, _helloMessage);
    helloMessage = _helloMessage;
  }
}
```

The `hello` function returns the value set to `helloMessage` and another function, `setHello`, changes the value of `helloMessage` to whatever argument is passed into the function.

Now that we have created our smart contract, we can deploy it to Avalanche.

### Write the Deployment Script

Our deployment script will contain a single `main` function that calls the `getContractFactory` method on the `ethers` library, passes in `HelloWorld` as the name of the contract, and runs a Hardhat method to deploy the contract.

Add the following deployment script to `scripts/deploy.js`:

```js
// scripts/deploy.js

async function main() {
  const HelloWorldFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory("HelloWorld")
  const helloMessage = await HelloWorldFactory.deploy("Hello from QuickNode")
  await helloMessage.deployed()

  console.log("Contract deployed to:", helloMessage.address)
  console.log("Contract deployed by " + JSON.stringify(helloMessage.signer) + " signer")
  process.exit(0)
}

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error)
    process.exit(1)
  })
```

`HelloWorldFactory` is deployed with a message (`Hello from QuickNode`) that is set as the default value of `helloMessage`. This is then called on the next line with the `deployed` method. Lastly, the address and signer for the contract are logged to the console.

### Hardhat Configuration

Now that we have our contract and a script to deploy it, the last step is to write our Hardhat configuration. The configuration specifies where the contract artifacts are placed in the project and what network the contract is deployed to.

Add the following configuration to `hardhat.config.js`:

```js
// hardhat.config.js

require("dotenv").config()
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers")
 
module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.6",
  paths: {
    artifacts: './src/artifacts',
  },
  networks: {
    fuji: {
      url: process.env.QUICKNODE_URL,
      accounts: [`0x` + process.env.PRIVATE_KEY],
      chainId: 43113,
    },
  },
}
```

We have specified the Solidity version, the path for the contract artifacts, and the network information for `fuji`. Before we can deploy this contract, we need to include two environment variables in our `.env` file. Navigate to the Coinbase Wallet extension, click on "Show Recovery Phrase", and scroll down to see your Ethereum private key. Copy your private key and set it to the `PRIVATE_KEY` variable.

![11-ethereum-private-key](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1654500431150/jAh_smVwA.png)

Next, visit the QuickNode dashboard and copy the HTTP provider URL for your endpoint. Paste the URL into your `.env` file and include `/ext/bc/C/rpc` at the very end of the URL to specify that you want to connect to the C-Chain. This chain is an instance of the Ethereum Virtual Machine that allows for creating smart contracts with the C-Chain's API.

### Deploy Contract to Fuji

Before deploying the contract, we need to first compile the contract. Run the following command:

```bash
yarn hardhat compile
```

Then, deploy the contract and include a `--network` flag to specify the Fuji test network.

```bash
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network fuji
```

If everything in your project is set up correctly, after running this script your terminal will output the following message but with your own addresses:

```
Contract deployed to: 0x873E3BB2A752DBDFA06017CC5a709600Ac3c0153
Contract deployed by "<SignerWithAddress 0x6b492Ef06CA3b462f20db50EB288fAbB1E3e8Bfc>" signer
```

Go to [Snowtrace Testnet](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/) and search for your contract address.

![12-contract-on-snowtrace](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1652250728271/wI7umL3qQ.png)

Include the contract address in `.env`, so it can be accessed from our frontend client in the next section.

## Create a React App

Our contract address can now be used to create a frontend client with React that interacts with the contract's methods.

Add the following React code to `src/App.jsx` to set up your app:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

import { useState } from 'react'
import { ethers } from 'ethers'
import HelloWorld from './artifacts/contracts/HelloWorld.sol/HelloWorld.json'

const contractAddress = import.meta.env.VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS

function App() {
  const [hello, setHelloValue] = useState()

  async function requestAccount() {
    await window.ethereum.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' })
  }

  async function fetchHello() {
    if (typeof window.ethereum !== 'undefined') {
      await requestAccount()
      const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum)
      const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, HelloWorld.abi, provider)
      try {
        const data = await contract.hello()
        setHelloValue(data)
        console.log('Greeting: ', data)
        console.log('Contract Address: ', contract.address)
      } catch (err) {
        console.log("Error: ", err)
      }
    }
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <header>
        <h1>Avalanche</h1>
      </header>

      <main>
        <h3>Hello World</h3>

        <button onClick={fetchHello}>
          Click me, you know you want to
        </button>

        <div>{hello}</div>
      </main>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

Navigate to the `index.html` and include the following stylesheet in the head of the html:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/water.css@2/out/water.css">
```

This provides default styles with [Water.css](https://watercss.kognise.dev/).

### Start Development Server

Run the following command to start the development server with Vite:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) with a browser to see the application:

![13-avalanche-react-app](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1652250986929/LSoVjcXYG.png)

To test the contract, connect your wallet and click the button below "Hello World". You should see a greeting message displayed below the button and logged to the console. 

![14-click-button-for-hello-message](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1652251014085/DG4d4zj83.png)

Now, let's update our code with one more feature. Return to `src/App.jsx` and add the following `setHello` function after `fetchHello` but before the return statement:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

async function setHello() {
  if (!hello) return
  if (typeof window.ethereum !== 'undefined') {
    await requestAccount()
    const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum)
    const signer = provider.getSigner()
    const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, HelloWorld.abi, signer)
    const transaction = await contract.setHello(hello)
    await transaction.wait()
    fetchHello()
  }
}
```

Include the following code in the return statement below the `fetchHello` button:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

<input
  onChange={e => setHelloValue(e.target.value)}
  placeholder="Set hello message"
/>
<button onClick={setHello}>
  Set hello message
</button>
```

Now, when you enter a new hello message and click the "Set hello message" button, you are asked to confirm the transaction from your Coinbase wallet. After confirming the transaction, it is pending for a few seconds. Once the transaction settles, the new message is logged to the console.

![15-new-greeting-displayed-in-the-console](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1652374126339/kI04pabHZ.png)

### Configure Netlify Deployment

Our hello world application is complete and we can deploy it to the internet with a service like [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Create a `netlify.toml` file for our Netlify configuration.

```bash
echo > netlify.toml
```

Add the following instructions to the `netlify.toml` file:

```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "yarn build"
```

The build command is set to `yarn build` and the publish directory is set to `dist`.

### Create GitHub Repository

Initialize a Git repository and push the project to a GitHub repo.

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "let it snow let it snow let it snow"
gh repo create getting-started-with-avalanche --public --push \
  --source=. \
  --description="Deploy a smart contract to Avalanche's Fuji Testnet with Hardhat, Ethers, and QuickNode" \
  --remote=upstream
```

We used the GitHub CLI, but you can also visit [repo.new](https://repo.new) and follow the instructions provided there. 

### Deploy to Netlify

Go to your Netlify dashboard, click "Add new site," and select the newly created repo.

![16-import-project-from-git-repository-on-netlify](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1652374504739/ueqhFEwpG.png)

Your build settings are imported from the `netlify.toml` file. The only other information you need to include is your contract address under "Advanced build settings." Lastly, click "Deploy site."

![17-include-environment-variable-for-contract-address-on-netlify](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1652374636506/kcRJ0Mkor.png)

Go to "Domain settings" to give your site a custom domain. You can see this example at [ajcwebdev-avalanche.netlify.app](https://ajcwebdev-avalanche.netlify.app/).

You should see your site live at your custom domain similar to this:

![18-deployed-website-on-netlify](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1652374868431/DYXiMhe8J.png)
