> _This is a sponsored article for the [LogRocket Blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/web3-data-querying-the-graph-subgraphs/) that demonstrates how to build a GraphQL subgraph to query on-chain data. Huge thanks to Nader Dabit for his [Subgraph Workshop Repo](https://github.com/dabit3/building-a-subgraph-workshop) which provided the basis for the project in this tutorial._

> _Unlike Nader's repo, this tutorial walks through building the project totally from scratch starting with a blank repository in contrast to using the `graph init` command to automatically scaffold a project._

## Introduction

The Graph is an indexing protocol for organizing blockchain data. It uses a GraphQL API to provide easier access to on-chain information than the traditional method of sending an RPC call. The network organizes the data with **subgraphs**.

Subgraphs are open-source APIs created by the community and are used for retrieving data from Indexers, Curators, and Delegators. In this article, we're going to be taking a look at how you can use The Graph and subgraphs for Web3 data querying.

All the code for this example can be found [on my GitHub](https://github.com/ajcwebdev/logrocketgraph).

### Indexers Operate the Network Nodes

[Indexers](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/indexing/) operate the nodes of the network, which index data and serve the queries. Since the Graph Network uses a proof-of-stake algorithm, indexers stake Graph Tokens (GRT) to provide indexing and query processing services.

In turn, Indexers can earn query fees and indexing rewards by selecting subgraphs to index based on the subgraph's curation signal. Applications consuming the indexer's data can set parameters for their preferred Indexers and query fee pricing.

### Curators Signal High Quality Subgraphs

[Curators](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/curating/) organize data from the subgraphs by signaling on the subgraphs that should be indexed by the Graph Network. They do this using Graph Curation Shares (GCS), which allow them to place the equivalent of an investment on a subgraph. Curators stake GRT, which allows them to mint GCS.

Each subgraph has a bonding curve that determines the relationship between the price of GRT and the number of shares that can be minted. According to the Graph's documentation, curating is considered risky and should only be performed after thoroughly researching and investigating the trade-offs involved.

### Delegators Secure the Network by Staking

[Delegators](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/delegating/) stake GRT to one or more Indexers to help secure the network without having to run a node themselves. Delegators earn portions of the Indexer's query fees and rewards, which is dependent on the Indexer's and Delegator's stake, along with the price the Indexer charges for each query.

Allocating more stake to an Indexer allows more potential queries to be processed. The Graph's documentation claims that being a Delegator carries less risk than being a Curator because they are not exposed to fluctuations in the price of GRT, due to burning shares of GCS.

### The Graph Foundation and the Three Different Graph Services

The Graph is developed and maintained by The Graph Foundation. To make sure the network and larger community continues to improve, the foundation distributes grants (called Graph Grants) to community members working on protocol infrastructure, tooling, dApps, subgraphs, and community building. There are three different ways to interact with the Graph if you are not hosting your own subgraph:

* **Graph Explorer**: Explore different subgraphs and interact with the Graph protocol
* **Subgraph Studio**: Create, manage, and publish subgraphs and API keys using Ethereum Mainnet
* **Hosted Service**: Create, manage, and publish subgraphs and API keys using other networks aside from Ethereum, such as Avalanche, Harmony, Fantom, and Celo

The hosted service does not require a crypto wallet and can be used with a GitHub account. The Graph Explorer and Subgraph Studio will both ask you to connect a wallet such as MetaMask or Coinbase.

## Create Hosted Service Project

After creating an account on the hosted service, click **My Dashboard** on the navigation bar to see your dashboard.

![Hosted Service My Dashboard](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1659805743704/WfPlVOxif.png)

Click **Add Subgraph** to create a subgraph.

![Hosted Service Create A Subgraph](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1659805751192/NtRMV9_Sk.png)

Add a name and subtitle for your subgraph. Once you've filled in your subgraph's information, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click **Create subgraph**.

![Hosted Service Name Install Deploy](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1659805757868/4iVb_5PtT.png)

## Create Project Files

With our subgraph setup on the hosted service, we can create our project files. Create a new directory, initialize a `package.json`, and install dependencies.

```bash
mkdir logrocketgraph
cd logrocketgraph
yarn init -y
yarn add -D @graphprotocol/graph-cli @graphprotocol/graph-ts
```

Copy the access token available on your project dashboard on Hosted Service. Paste the token after the `yarn graph auth --product hosted-service` command.

```bash
yarn graph auth --product hosted-service YOURTOKEN
```

Create configuration files for TypeScript and Git.

```bash
echo '{"extends": "@graphprotocol/graph-ts/types/tsconfig.base.json"}' > tsconfig.json
echo '.DS_Store\nnode_modules' > .gitignore
```

Smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain expose an application binary interface (or ABI) as an interface between client-side applications and the Ethereum blockchain. Since we will need this for our subgraph, cURL the contract's ABI to a file called `Token.json`.

```bash
curl "http://api.etherscan.io/api?module=contract&action=getabi&address=0xe7c29cba93ef8017c7824dd0f25923c38d08065c&format=raw" > Token.json
```

Create the following files:

```bash
echo > token.ts
echo > schema.graphql
echo > subgraph.yaml
```

These will include:

* `token.ts` for AssemblyScript code that translates Ethereum event data into the entities defined in the scheme
* `subgraph.yaml` for a YAML configuration of the subgraph's manifest
* `schema.graphql` for a GraphQL schema defining the data stored for the subgraph and how to query it via GraphQL

### Create GraphQL Schema with Token and User Entities

In `schema.graphql` we've defined two types, `Token` and `User`.

```graphql
# schema.graphql

type Token @entity {}
type User @entity {}
```

The `Token` has a `name` and other information such as when it was created, the content URI, and the IPFS file path. It also includes information about the `creator` and `owner`.

```graphql
# schema.graphql

type Token @entity {
  id: ID!
  tokenID: BigInt!
  contentURI: String
  tokenIPFSPath: String
  name: String!
  createdAtTimestamp: BigInt!
  creator: User!
  owner: User!
}

type User @entity {}
```

The `creator` and `owner` are `User` types. They have an `id`, an array of `tokens` they own, and an array of `tokens` they've `created`.

```graphql
# schema.graphql

type Token @entity {...}

type User @entity {
  id: ID!
  tokens: [Token!]! @derivedFrom(field: "owner")
  created: [Token!]! @derivedFrom(field: "creator")
}
```

`@derivedFrom` enables reverse lookups, which means we do not store both sides of the relationship to improve indexing and query performance. For one-to-many relationships, the relationship should be stored on the “one” side with the “many” side derived from it.

### Create Subgraph

The `subgraph.yaml` file will contain the definition of our subgraph. Start with the version of the specification used and a file path to the entity types in `schema.graphql`.

```yaml
# subgraph.yaml

specVersion: 0.0.4
schema:
  file: ./schema.graphql
```

Next is the network containing our data sources. `dataSources.source` needs the address and ABI of the smart contract.

```yaml
# subgraph.yaml

dataSources:
  - kind: ethereum
    name: Token
    network: mainnet
    source:
      address: "0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405"
      abi: Token
      startBlock: 11648721
```

`dataSources.mapping.entities` defines the entities that the data source writes to the store and is specified by the schema in `schema.graphql`.

```yaml
# subgraph.yaml

mapping:
  kind: ethereum/events
  apiVersion: 0.0.5
  language: wasm/assemblyscript
  entities:
    - Token
    - User
```

`dataSources.mapping.abis` takes the `name` and `file` location of the ABI for the source contract.

```yaml
# subgraph.yaml

abis:
  - name: Token
    file: ./Token.json
```

`dataSources.mapping.eventHandlers` lists the smart contract events the subgraph reacts to and the handlers in the mappings that transform these events into entities in the store.

```yaml
# subgraph.yaml

eventHandlers:
  - event: TokenIPFSPathUpdated(indexed uint256,indexed string,string)
    handler: handleTokenIPFSPathUpdated
  - event: Transfer(indexed address,indexed address,indexed uint256)
    handler: handleTransfer
file: ./token.ts
```

Complete `subgraph.yaml` file:

```yaml
# subgraph.yaml

specVersion: 0.0.4
schema:
  file: ./schema.graphql
dataSources:
  - kind: ethereum
    name: Token
    network: mainnet
    source:
      address: "0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405"
      abi: Token
      startBlock: 11648721
    mapping:
      kind: ethereum/events
      apiVersion: 0.0.5
      language: wasm/assemblyscript
      entities:
        - Token
        - User
      abis:
        - name: Token
          file: ./Token.json
      eventHandlers:
        - event: TokenIPFSPathUpdated(indexed uint256,indexed string,string)
          handler: handleTokenIPFSPathUpdated
        - event: Transfer(indexed address,indexed address,indexed uint256)
          handler: handleTransfer
      file: ./token.ts
```

### Generate Types and Write Mappings

Generate AssemblyScript types for the ABI and the subgraph schema.

```bash
yarn graph codegen
```

When a new token is created, transferred, or updated, an event is fired and the mappings save the data into the subgraph. Create the following two functions after importing the generated types and schema:

* `handleTransfer`
* `handleTokenURIUpdated`

```ts
// token.ts

import {
  TokenIPFSPathUpdated as TokenIPFSPathUpdatedEvent,
  Transfer as TransferEvent,
  Token as TokenContract,
} from "./generated/Token/Token"
import {
  Token, User
} from "./generated/schema"

export function handleTransfer(
  event: TransferEvent
): void {}

export function handleTokenURIUpdated(
  event: TokenIPFSPathUpdatedEvent
): void {}
```

The `handleTransfer` function loads the `tokenId` and sets the `owner`.

```ts
// token.ts

import {...} from "./generated/Token/Token"
import {...} from "./generated/schema"

export function handleTransfer(event: TransferEvent): void {
  let token = Token.load(event.params.tokenId.toString())
  if (!token) {
    token = new Token(event.params.tokenId.toString())
    token.creator = event.params.to.toHexString()
    token.tokenID = event.params.tokenId

    let tokenContract = TokenContract.bind(event.address)
    token.contentURI = tokenContract.tokenURI(event.params.tokenId)
    token.tokenIPFSPath = tokenContract.getTokenIPFSPath(event.params.tokenId)
    token.name = tokenContract.name()
    token.createdAtTimestamp = event.block.timestamp
  }
  token.owner = event.params.to.toHexString()
  token.save()

  let user = User.load(event.params.to.toHexString())
  if (!user) {
    user = new User(event.params.to.toHexString())
    user.save()
  }
}

export function handleTokenURIUpdated(
  event: TokenIPFSPathUpdatedEvent
): void {}
```

The `handleTokenURIUpdated` function updates the `tokenIPFSPath` anytime it changes.

```ts
// token.ts

import {...} from "./generated/Token/Token"
import {...} from "./generated/schema"

export function handleTransfer(
  event: TransferEvent
): void {...}

export function handleTokenURIUpdated(event: TokenIPFSPathUpdatedEvent): void {
  let token = Token.load(event.params.tokenId.toString())
  if (!token) return
  token.tokenIPFSPath = event.params.tokenIPFSPath
  token.save()
}
```

## Deploy Subgraph

Build your project for deployment:

```bash
yarn graph build
```

Include your own GitHub username followed by the name of your subgraph:

```bash
yarn graph deploy --product hosted-service USERNAME/logrocketgraph
```

The terminal will return a URL with an explorer for the subgraph and an API endpoint for sending queries.

```
Deployed to https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/ajcwebdev/logrocketgraph

Subgraph endpoints:
Queries (HTTP): https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/ajcwebdev/logrocketgraph
```

You will likely need to wait while your subgraph syncs with the current state of the blockchain.

### Run Tokens and Users Test Queries

Once the syncing is complete, you can begin sending queries. You can use the HTTP endpoint and send GraphQL queries directly with cURL.

```bash
curl \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --url 'https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/ajcwebdev/logrocketgraph' \
  --data '{"query":"{ tokens(first: 1) { contentURI tokenIPFSPath } }"}'
```

This will output the `contentURI` and `tokenIPFSPath` for the first token in the collection:

```json
{
   "data":{
      "tokens":[
         {
            "contentURI":"https://ipfs.foundation.app/ipfs/QmcsepfMDFh2udUQWtvcnZeARNFFCPA1n2WRWUH1ysWv4W/metadata.json",
            "tokenIPFSPath":"QmcsepfMDFh2udUQWtvcnZeARNFFCPA1n2WRWUH1ysWv4W/metadata.json"
         }
      ]
   }
}
```

To see the token's metadata, open the [link to `metadata.json` in the `contentURI`](https://ipfs.foundation.app/ipfs/QmcsepfMDFh2udUQWtvcnZeARNFFCPA1n2WRWUH1ysWv4W/metadata.json) or go to the [IPFS content hash with `ipfs.io` and the content identifier in `tokenIPFSPath`](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcsepfMDFh2udUQWtvcnZeARNFFCPA1n2WRWUH1ysWv4W/metadata.json).

```json
{
  "name": "Ancient Future",
  "description": "Here at the nexus of infinity, we inscribe ourselves upon the sacred discs. For We are the Ancients of a Future Civilization. \n\nSingle Edition VHS Text Art by Sarah Zucker, 2020. Created in studio with Hi8 Camcorder Title Feedback, digital animation and analog processing on VHS. Filmed in 4K from vintage CRT TV screen.\n",
  "image": "ipfs://ipfs/QmXRmfvvenqr4eJ62vjxvYqc5eWp6i2MjpkTh9VZcLiuTi/nft.mp4"
}
```

The `image` (which is actually a video) can be viewed at [ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXRmfvvenqr4eJ62vjxvYqc5eWp6i2MjpkTh9VZcLiuTi/nft.mp4](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXRmfvvenqr4eJ62vjxvYqc5eWp6i2MjpkTh9VZcLiuTi/nft.mp4).

Run the following query to show the first two tokens ordered by `id` in descending order.

```
{
  tokens(first: 2, orderBy: id, orderDirection: desc) {
    id
    tokenID
    contentURI
    tokenIPFSPath
  }
}
```

This will output the following:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "tokens": [
      {
        "id": "99999",
        "tokenID": "99999",
        "contentURI": "https://ipfs.foundation.app/ipfs/QmdDdmRAw8zgmN9iE23oz14a55oHGWtqBrR1RbFcFq4Abn/metadata.json",
        "tokenIPFSPath": "QmdDdmRAw8zgmN9iE23oz14a55oHGWtqBrR1RbFcFq4Abn/metadata.json"
      },
      {
        "id": "99998",
        "tokenID": "99998",
        "contentURI": "https://ipfs.foundation.app/ipfs/QmZwZ5ChjHNwAS5rFDGkom2GpZvTau6xzr8M7gro5HqQhB/metadata.json",
        "tokenIPFSPath": "QmZwZ5ChjHNwAS5rFDGkom2GpZvTau6xzr8M7gro5HqQhB/metadata.json"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Query for the two most recently created NFTs.

```
{
  tokens(
    first: 2,
    orderBy: createdAtTimestamp,
    orderDirection: desc
  ) {
    id
    tokenID
    contentURI
    createdAtTimestamp
  }
}
```

This will output the following:

```json
{
   "data":{
      "tokens":[
         {
            "id":"133012",
            "tokenID":"133012",
            "contentURI":"https://ipfs.foundation.app/ipfs/QmSmk85TjpaegCmHDRWZQqMz18vJtACZdugVx5a1tmfjpv/metadata.json",
            "createdAtTimestamp":"1656792769"
         },
         {
            "id":"133011",
            "tokenID":"133011",
            "contentURI":"https://ipfs.foundation.app/ipfs/QmU6RFcKFDteUTipg5tg4NFkWKApdVbo9oq9UYMtSmcWVe/metadata.json",
            "createdAtTimestamp":"1653825764"
         }
      ]
   }
}
```

Query for the first user and their associated content.

```
{
  users(first: 1, orderBy: id, orderDirection: desc) {
    id
    tokens {
      contentURI
    }
  }
}
```

This will output the first user's `id` and the `contentURI` of each of their `tokens`:

```json
{
   "data":{
      "users":[
         {
            "id":"0xfffff449f1a35eb0facca8d4659d8e15cf2f77ba",
            "tokens":[
               {
                  "contentURI":"https://ipfs.foundation.app/ipfs/QmVkXqo2hmC2j18udhZG1KavxaTGrnEX7uuddEbghPKCUW/metadata.json"
               },
               {

            ]
         }
      ]
   }
}
```

## Conclusion

In this article we have seen how to create a GraphQL endpoint that exposes certain information contained on the Ethereum blockchain. By writing a schema containing our entities, we defined the information that will be indexed by the subgraph.

The quantity and diversity of blockchain networks continues to proliferate in Web3. Having a standardized and widely adopted query language will enable developers to iterate and and test their applications with greater velocity.
