## Introduction

[__tRPC__](https://trpc.io/) is a TypeScript library for building end-to-end, type-safe APIs. It creates fully typed endpoints on the backend which can be queried from a frontend written in TypeScript. While it is typically integrated with React or Next, it can be used with [__Vue__](https://github.com/michealroberts/usetrpc), [__Svelte__](https://github.com/icflorescu/trpc-sveltekit), or plain TypeScript.

The project began in [__July 2020__](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/tree/1ca033cdfc8fc4b503a055f1075c1a3903f17d54) as a proof of concept from Colin McDonnell, the creator of [__Zod__](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod). Originally called __ZodRPC__, Colin described it as "a toolkit for creating type-safe backends powered by Zod." What is Zod, you say? Glad you asked!

### Schema Validation with Zod

Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library that uses a "schema" to broadly refer to any data type which can be declared with static types in TypeScript. Here is how Colin described Zod when the project was first released:

> _Zod is a validation library designed for optimal developer experience. It's a TypeScript-first schema declaration library with rigorous (and correct!) inferred types, incredible developer experience, and a few killer features missing from the existing libraries._

> - _Uses Typescript generic inference to statically infer the types of your schemas._
> - _Eliminates the need to keep static types and runtime validators in sync by hand._
> - _Has a composable, declarative API that makes it easy to define complex types concisely._
> 
> ***Colin McDonnell - [Designing the perfect Typescript schema validation library](https://colinhacks.com/essays/zod) (March 8, 2020)***

With ZodRPC, Colin hoped to build a new library that would extend the functionality of Zod to the point of offering an alternative to GraphQL. The key to the project's success would be retaining the simplicity of RPC calls which consist of only named functions that accept arguments and return values.

Colin knew ZodRPC (later renamed to tRPC) had the potential to provide a similar experience to GraphQL's end to end type-safety but without all the associated tooling and boilerplate code accompanying most GraphQL projects. Here is how he described it in ***[Building an end-to-end type-safe API without GraphQL](https://colinhacks.com/essays/painless-typesafety) (June 13, 2021)***:

> _Most people use GraphQL as a massively over-engineered way to share the __type signature__ of their API with your client. What if you could import that type signature __directly into your client__ using plain ole `import` syntax? Well... you can._

Colin didn't continue to maintain the project after creating it and chose to appoint a successor instead. Once he finished creating the initial proof of concept he handed the project off to [__Alex "KATT" Johansson__](https://twitter.com/alexdotjs).

Alex has been maintaining the project ever since. It has gained a large cult following in the time since Alex took over the project and his leadership has been so inextricably integral to the project that many assume that he created the project.

### Similarities and Differences with GraphQL

Throughout 2022, tRPC was increasingly pitted against GraphQL as an existential threat ironically mirroring the evangelism of GraphQL over REST over half a decade ago. I've recently been seeing lots of mea culpas and "I told you so's" on GraphQL due to the current rise of tRPC.

But I've seen reasonable takes from developers (only some of which work for GraphQL companies) who believe in the staying power of GraphQL and argue it still has unique strengths that make it a superior choice over tRPC in certain cases. This topic would require an entirely separate blog post to thoroughly analyze the disparate considerations.

In lieu of that post, I'll quickly highlight a few of the resources already available on this topic and direct the readers to those links to learn more. First and foremost, here's how my old StepZen co-worker, Roy Derks, compares the two in [***Can you compare GraphQL and tRPC? (November 27, 2022)***](https://hackteam.io/blog/compare-graphql-and-trpc):

> _GraphQL is a query language for your API, while tRPC is a set of libraries for building end-to-end type-safe APIs. GraphQL uses HTTP as a transport layer with GraphQL queries sent as POST requests. It excels in combining multiple data sources into a single query and is often used for data modeling and architecture._
> 
> _tRPC is not really meant for combining multiple data sources. It's a set of libraries that use TypeScript to ensure type safety throughout the application. Its primary purpose is making it easy to build end-to-end type-safe applications in a single codebase by using the same types in your frontend and backend._

In [***The simplicity of tRPC with the power of GraphQL (December 11, 2022)***](https://wundergraph.com/blog/trpc_vs_graphql), Jens Neuse from Wundergraph says you should consider the following context when deciding whether the strengths of GraphQL outweigh its weaknesses:

> _The great developer experience of tRPC is achieved by merging two very different concerns into one concept, API implementation and data consumption. It's important to understand that this is a trade-off. There's no free lunch. The simplicity of tRPC comes at the cost of flexibility._
> 
> _With GraphQL, you have to invest a lot more into schema design, but this investment pays off the moment you have to scale your application to many but related pages. By separating API implementation from data fetching it becomes much easier to re-use the same API implementation for different use cases._

Finally, for the most thorough discussion comparing tRPC and GraphQL I'd recommend watching Theo's [GraphQL, tRPC, and REST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfccwYUD8H0) video followed by his debate with Max Stoiber, [Discussing tRPC & GraphQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-407yO8nEU). In the [months before this debate](https://twitter.com/t3dotgg/status/1598100163528052736/), Theo tweeted the following chart along with the message:

> tRPC is not the death of GraphQL, it just means I reach for it way less :)

![02 - Theo tRPC vs GraphQL Tweet](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fi2XIpnVIAAEzVm?format=png&name=4096x4096)

## Project Setup

To begin, create a blank directory with a `.gitignore` file and initialize a `package.json` with `pnpm`.

```bash
mkdir ajcwebdev-trpc
cd ajcwebdev-trpc
echo 'node_modules\n.DS_Store\n.env' >> .gitignore
pnpm init
```

### Add Scripts and Install Dependencies

We'll add three scripts to our project's `package.json`. These perform the following commands:

- `dev:server` - runs the development server with `tsx`
- `build:server` - creates a bundle in `dist`
- `start:server` - runs the bundle generated in `dist`

```json
{
  "name": "ajcwebdev-trpc",
  "description": "An example tRPC project",
  "keywords": [ "tRPC", "Zod", "React", "Next" ],
  "author": "Anthony Campolo",
  "license": "MIT",
  "scripts": {
    "dev:server": "tsx watch src/server/index.ts",
    "build:server": "tsc",
    "start:server": "node dist/index.js"
  }
}
```

For the server side dependencies we'll install tRPC's server implementation `@trpc/server` and `zod`.

```bash
pnpm add @trpc/server zod superjson
```

For development dependencies on the server we'll install `npm-run-all`, `tsx`, `typescript`, and `@types/node` for the [Node.js type definitions from `DefinitelyTyped`](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped).

```bash
pnpm add -D @types/node tsx typescript npm-run-all
```

### Configure TypeScript Compiler Options

Create a `tsconfig.json` file for your TypeScript configuration on the server.

```bash
echo >> tsconfig.json
```

Include the following compiler options which I copy pasted from a tRPC example app and do not understand at all.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "strict": true,
    "lib": ["DOM", "DOM.Iterable", "ESNext"],
    "module": "esnext",
    "target": "esnext",
    "declaration": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "jsx": "react-jsx"
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules"],
  "include": ["src", "vite.config.ts"]
}
```

### Create Project Files

For a Hello World example, we can create an entire server in a single `index.ts` file. After demonstrating how to do this, we'll break apart the server into multiple files in a structure that reflects the organization of larger, real world tRPC applications.

```bash
mkdir src src/server
echo >> src/server/index.ts
```

Since we'll create a client application later in the tutorial, the `index.ts` server file is placed in a directory called `server` to differentiate between the two sides.

## Create HTTP Server

`initTRPC` initializes a tRPC variable `t` which can setup a request context, metadata, or runtime configuration. `createHTTPServer` is imported from the [__`standalone` adapter in `@trpc/server`__](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/blob/main/packages/server/src/adapters/standalone.ts) and used to initialize an HTTP server with Node.js.

```ts
// src/server/index.ts

import { initTRPC } from '@trpc/server'
import { createHTTPServer } from '@trpc/server/adapters/standalone'

const PORT = 2022

const t = initTRPC.create()

const router = t.router
const publicProcedure = t.procedure

const appRouter = router({
  hello: publicProcedure
    .query(() => `hello from trpc standalone http server`)
})

export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter

const { listen } = createHTTPServer({
  router: appRouter
})

console.log(`listening on localhost:${PORT}`)
listen(PORT)
```

There are adapters for other Node environments including:
- [AWS Lambda](https://trpc.io/docs/aws-lambda)
- [Express](https://trpc.io/docs/express)
- [Fastify](https://trpc.io/docs/fastify)

There are also a set of adapters that utilize the Fetch API including:
- [Cloudflare Workers](https://trpc.io/docs/fetch#cloudflare-worker)
- [Deno Deploy](https://trpc.io/docs/fetch#deno-deploy)
- [Next.js Edge Runtime](https://trpc.io/docs/fetch#nextjs-edge-runtime)
- [Vercel Edge Runtime](https://trpc.io/docs/fetch#vercel-edge-runtime)

### Run Node HTTP Server

Start the Node server located in `index.ts` with `tsx` in `watch` mode by running `pnpm dev:server`:

```bash
pnpm dev:server
```

The terminal should display a message saying, `listening on localhost:2022`. With cURL, perform a `GET` request on `http://localhost:2022/hello` to receive a JSON response from the `hello` route:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:2022/hello"
```

You'll receive the following output:

```json
{"result":{"data":"hello from trpc standalone http server"}}
```

### Create Context

As our project grows and more routes are added, it will be more maintainable to break apart pieces of the code into multiple, modular files. This will help to clearly delineate between the different routes and the boilerplate code necessary to setup tRPC. Create a file called `context.ts`.

```bash
echo >> src/server/context.ts
```

tRPC should be initialized exactly once per application with `initTRPC`. If you initialize more than one instance of tRPC you will potentially run into issues.

```ts
// src/server/context.ts

import { initTRPC } from '@trpc/server'

const t = initTRPC.create()

export const router = t.router
export const publicProcedure = t.procedure
```

### Create Hello Router

The fundamental unit of a tRPC-based API is a router. Create a `routes` directory and `hello.ts` file for defining your router called `helloRouter`.

```bash
mkdir src/server/routes
echo >> src/server/routes/hello.ts
```

A router will contain a procedure that exposes an API "endpoint." Import `publicProcedure` from `context.ts`.

```ts
// src/server/routes/hello.ts

import { publicProcedure } from '../context'

export const helloRouter = publicProcedure
  .query(() => `hello from the hello route`)
```

Import `helloRouter` and create a `hello` route by setting `helloRouter` to `hello` in the `router` object.

```ts
// src/server/index.ts

import { router } from './context'
import { createHTTPServer } from '@trpc/server/adapters/standalone'
import { helloRouter } from './routes/hello'

const PORT = 2022

const appRouter = router({
  hello: helloRouter
})

export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter

const { listen } = createHTTPServer({
  router: appRouter,
})

console.log(`listening on localhost:${PORT}`)
listen(PORT)
```

Run the cURL request again to see the new output.

```bash
curl "http://localhost:2022/hello"
```

You'll receive the following output:

```json
{"result":{"data":"hello from the hello route"}}
```

### Add Input Validation with Zod

As mentioned in the introduction, Zod is a library for schema declaration and validation. It can create a "schema" that broadly refers to any data type which can be declared with static types in TypeScript. It comes with a handful of [built-in primitive types](https://zod.dev/?id=primitives) that are commonly used in TypeScript projects:

- Primitive values include `string`, `number`, `bigint`, `boolean`, `date`, and `symbol`.
- Empty types include `undefined`, `null`, and `void` which accepts `undefined`.
- `any` and `unknown` are catch-all types that allow any values.
- `never` does not allow any values.

```ts
// src/server/routes/hello.ts

import { publicProcedure } from '../context'
import { z } from 'zod'

export const helloRouter = publicProcedure
  .input(
    z.string().nullish()
  )
  .query(({ input }) => {
    return `hello from the ${input ?? 'query fallback'}`
  })
```

If you were to query `http://localhost:2022/hello` again, the `data` object would contain a string with the message `hello from the query fallback`. But we can also pass an `input` to change the resulting message. Run the cURL request one more time but with a URL encoded string input to see the new output.

```bash
curl "http://localhost:2022/hello?input=%22input%22"
```

You'll receive the following output:

```json
{"result":{"data":"hello from the input"}}
```

What if we wanted to validate something more complex than a single `string`? We can change `z.string` to `z.object` and specify a key-value pair where the key is `name` and the value is a `string` containing a name.

```ts
// src/server/routes/hello.ts

import { publicProcedure } from '../context'
import { z } from 'zod'

export const helloRouter = publicProcedure
  .input(
    z.object({
      name: z.string().nullish()
    })
  )
  .query(({ input }) => {
    return {
      text: `hello from ${input?.name ?? 'input fallback'}`
    }
  })
```

```bash
curl "http://localhost:2022/hello?batch=1&input=%7B%220%22%3A%7B%22name%22%3A%22Next.js%20Edge%22%7D%7D"
```

This time you will receive an array containing a `result` object with the key-value pair set to `data`.

```json
[{"result":{"data":{"text":"hello from Next.js Edge"}}}]
```

Since managing all the URL encoding is a huge pain, you can also use a tool like Insomnia or Postman to make HTTP requests with JSON objects as the input.

## Create React Client

Create a set of strongly-typed React hooks from your `AppRouter` type signature with `createTRPCReact`. This initializes a `trpc` client instance from `@trpc/react-query` which provides a thin wrapper over `@tanstack/react-query`.

We'll be installing the following project dependencies for the client side:

- `react` - the React core library
- `react-dom` - React's DOM rendering library
- `@trpc/client` - tRPC's client implementation
- `@trpc/react-query` - tRPC's React Query wrapper
- `@tanstack/react-query` - TanStack's React Query

```bash
pnpm add @tanstack/react-query @trpc/client \
  @trpc/react-query react react-dom
```

For development dependencies on the client we'll be installing `vite`, the `@vitejs/plugin-react` plugin, and types for `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom`.

```bash
pnpm add -D @vitejs/plugin-react vite \
  @types/react @types/react-dom
```

Replace your current project scripts with the following:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev:server": "tsx watch src/server/index.ts",
    "build:server": "tsc",
    "start:server": "node dist/index.js",
    "dev:client": "vite",
    "build:client": "tsc && vite build",
    "start:client": "vite preview",
    "dev": "run-p dev:*",
    "build": "run-s build:server build:client",
    "start": "run-p start:*"
  }
}
```

### Configure Vite and Add Reference Types

Create a `vite-env.d.ts` file.

```bash
echo '/// <reference types="vite/client" />' >> vite-env.d.ts
```

Create a `vite.config.js` file.

```bash
echo >> vite.config.ts
```

Import `react` from `@vitejs/plugin-react` and set it to `plugins` in the `defineConfig` object.

```ts
// vite.config.ts

import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()]
})
```

### Add HTML Entry Point and Root Component

The root component will be imported as an ESM module from `/src/pages/index.tsx` and set to the `src` attribute.

```bash
echo >> index.html
```

Include a boilerplate HTML page that imports a root component from `src/pages/_app.tsx` and renders it into a `div` element. In the next section, we'll create this file and include a root component that imports and returns an HTML paragraph element from another file representing our homepage.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <meta name="description" content="An example tRPC application." />
    <title>A First Look at tRPC</title>
  </head>
  
  <body>
    <noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="/src/pages/_app.tsx" type="module"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Your React application can be organized in any fashion you prefer, but for this example I'm going to structure the files and directories like a Next.js project using the `pages` directory so that we can seamlessly migrate in the next section.

```bash
mkdir src/pages
echo >> src/pages/index.tsx
```

The `Index` component will return a message saying, `Hello from React!`.

```tsx
// src/pages/index.tsx

export default function Index() {
  return <p>Hello from React!</p>
}
```

Create a file called `_app.tsx` inside the `pages` directory.

```bash
echo >> src/pages/_app.tsx
```

Here we will use `createRoot` to `render` the `root` component which contains the `Index` component.

```tsx
// src/pages/_app.tsx

import { StrictMode } from 'react'
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
import Index from "./index"

createRoot(document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement)
  .render(
    <StrictMode>
      <Index />
    </StrictMode>
  )
```

The server should still be running with the previous `pnpm dev:server` command. Run the following command to start up the development server for the React client.

```bash
pnpm dev:client
```

Open [`localhost:5173`](http://localhost:5173/) to see the React app.

![04 - Hello World React App](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u0l48ehuab1jn15c6udh.png)

### Create Hello Query with Tanstack Query Client

```bash
mkdir src/components
echo >> src/components/Hello.tsx
```

```tsx
// src/components/Hello.tsx

import { api } from "../pages/index"

export function Hello() {
  const hello = api.hello.useQuery({ name: "React Query" })
  console.log(hello)
  const { data, status, isSuccess, isError, error } = hello
  
  return (
    <>
      <h3>Data Object</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><code>hello.data</code>: <b>{JSON.stringify(data)}</b></li>
        <li><code>hello.data?.text</code>: <b>{JSON.stringify(data?.text)}</b></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Status Values</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><code>hello.status</code>: <b>{JSON.stringify(status)}</b></li>
        <li><code>hello.isSuccess</code>: <b>{JSON.stringify(isSuccess)}</b></li>
        <li><code>hello.isError</code>: <b>{JSON.stringify(isError)}</b></li>
        <li><code>hello.error</code>: <b>{JSON.stringify(error)}</b></li>
      </ul>
    </>
  )
}
```

We'll initialize the TanStack Query client in `index.tsx`:

- [`QueryClient`](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/reference/QueryClient) is used to interact with React Query's cache. `queryClient`
- [`QueryClientProvider`](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/reference/QueryClientProvider) connects and provides `QueryClient` to the application.
- `createClient` and `trpcClient`
- [`httpBatchLink`](https://trpc.io/docs/links/httpBatchLink) is a terminating link that batches an array of individual tRPC operations into a single HTTP request that's sent to a single tRPC procedure. The terminating link is the last link in a link chain. Instead of calling the `next` function, the terminating link is responsible for sending your composed tRPC operation to the tRPC server and returning an `OperationResultEnvelope`.
- The `links` array added to the tRPC client config should have at least one link and that link should be a terminating link. If `links` don't have a terminating link at the end of them, the tRPC operation will not be sent to the tRPC server.

```tsx
// src/pages/index.tsx

import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query'
import { createTRPCReact } from '@trpc/react-query'
import { httpBatchLink } from '@trpc/client'
import { useState } from 'react'
import type { AppRouter } from '../server'
import { Hello } from "../components/Hello"

export const api = createTRPCReact<AppRouter>()

export default function Index() {
  const [ queryClient ] = useState(() => new QueryClient())
  const [ trpcClient ] = useState(() => api.createClient({
    links: [
      httpBatchLink({ url: 'http://localhost:2022' })
    ]
  }))

  return (
    <api.Provider client={trpcClient} queryClient={queryClient}>
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
        <Hello />
      </QueryClientProvider>
    </api.Provider>
  )
}
```

At this point you'll get the following error in your browser console:

> Access to fetch at `http://localhost:2022/hello?...` from origin `http://127.0.0.1:5173` has been blocked by CORS policy. Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check.
> 
> No `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header is present on requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set request's mode to `no-cors` to fetch resource with CORS disabled.

Oh no, CORS! Don't worry, I won't make you spend the next half hour reading the [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) page on MDN for the 50th time. We'll create an HTTP handler and set the correct access headers.

### Create HTTP Handler

The `createContext()` function is called for each request and the result is propagated to all resolvers. You can use this to pass contextual data down to the resolvers.

```ts
// src/server/index.ts

import { router } from './context'
import { createHTTPHandler } from '@trpc/server/adapters/standalone'
import { helloRouter } from './routes/hello'
import http from 'http'

const appRouter = router({
  hello: helloRouter
})

export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter

const handler = createHTTPHandler({
  router: appRouter
})

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*')
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Request-Method', '*')
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'OPTIONS, GET')
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', '*')
  if (req.method === 'OPTIONS') {
    res.writeHead(200)
    return res.end()
  }
  handler(req, res)
})

const PORT = 2022

server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`listening on localhost:${PORT}`)
})
```

Simultaneously run the server on [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000/) and the client on [`localhost:5173`](http://localhost:5173/) with `pnpm dev`.

```bash

Right now I'm displaying a few pieces of information contained in the `data` object that is returned by `useQuery`.

![05 - React App with tRPC Query](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/j0f2057euz6sox6ikrju.png)

The `data` object holds a bunch of stuff you may or may not need depending on what you are querying. I'd recommend using a `console.log` on the `data` object at least once to see all the properties, but here's a few of the most common you'll likely use while getting started with tRPC.

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "fetchStatus": "idle",
  "isLoading": false,
  "isSuccess": true,
  "isError": false,
  "data": {
    "text": "hello from from React Query"
  },
  "error": null,
  "trpc": {
    "path": "hello"
  }
}
```

## Migrate to Next

We've now seen how to create a standalone HTTP server with tRPC and a client application that queries the server with React. Lets use Next.js to migrate our server into API routes and query them with `@trpc/next`.

### Configure Project for Next

```bash
pnpm add @trpc/next next
```

Since Next includes a "server side" and a "client side," we no longer need separate scripts for tRPC and React. Replace the previous scripts with the following:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  }
}
```

Create a file called `next-env.d.ts` for Next's reference types. This file should not be edited, see the [Next.js TypeScript documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript) for more information.

```bash
echo '/// <reference types="next" />\n/// <reference types="next/image-types/global" />' >> next-env.d.ts
```

### Configure Next Project for Vercel Edge Runtime

We no longer need to worry about managing CORS or setting headers on our responses at all since Next.js will now manage that. We can remove everything except the `appRouter` and `AppRouter` type from `src/server/index.ts` since we don't need to run the server from this file anymore.

```ts
// src/server/index.ts

import { router } from './context'
import { helloRouter } from './routes/hello'

export const appRouter = router({
  hello: helloRouter
})

export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter
```

Instead of running a standalone Node server, we'll create an API Route in the `src/pages/api` directory called `[trpc].ts`. This is a Next.js convention for executing our backend JavaScript code in an isolated and fully managed environment.

```bash
mkdir src/pages/api
echo >> src/pages/api/\[trpc\].tsx
```

The code to run in this case will be a Node function that makes a fetch request via tRPC's `fetchRequestHandler`.

```ts
// src/pages/api/[trpc].ts

import { fetchRequestHandler } from '@trpc/server/adapters/fetch'
import { NextRequest } from 'next/server'
import { appRouter } from '../../server/index'

export default async function handler(req: NextRequest) {
  return fetchRequestHandler({})
}
```

Set the `endpoint` to `/api` and the `router` to `appRouter`. In `createContext` an arrow function is run that returns an empty JavaScript object and nothing else. We also set the `runtime` to `experimental-edge` inside our `config` object because this example uses the [Next.js Edge Runtime](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/edge-runtime) via tRPC's fetch adapter.

```ts
// src/pages/api/[trpc].ts

import { fetchRequestHandler } from '@trpc/server/adapters/fetch'
import { NextRequest } from 'next/server'
import { appRouter } from '../../server/index'

export default async function handler(req: NextRequest) {
  return fetchRequestHandler({
    endpoint: '/api',
    router: appRouter,
    req,
    createContext: () => ({}),
  })
}

export const config = {
  runtime: 'edge'
}
```

Edit the `Hello.tsx` component in `src/components`.

```tsx
// src/components/Hello.tsx

import { api } from "../pages/index"

export function Hello() {
  const hello = api.hello.useQuery({ name: "Next.js Edge" })
  const { data, status, isSuccess, isError, error } = hello

  if (!data) {
    return <h3>Loading...</h3>
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Data Object</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><code>hello.data</code>: <b>{JSON.stringify(data)}</b></li>
        <li><code>hello.data?.text</code>: <b>{JSON.stringify(data?.text)}</b></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Status Values</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><code>hello.status</code>: <b>{JSON.stringify(status)}</b></li>
        <li><code>hello.isSuccess</code>: <b>{JSON.stringify(isSuccess)}</b></li>
        <li><code>hello.isError</code>: <b>{JSON.stringify(isError)}</b></li>
        <li><code>hello.error</code>: <b>{JSON.stringify(error)}</b></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Import `createTRPCNext` from `@trpc/next` and initialize the client to a variable called `api`. The `config` argument is a function returning an object to configure the tRPC client. The returned value includes the `links` property to customize the flow of data in tRPC between the client and server.

```tsx
// src/pages/index.tsx

import { httpBatchLink } from '@trpc/client'
import { createTRPCNext } from '@trpc/next'
import type { AppRouter } from '../server/index'
import { Hello } from "../components/Hello"

function getBaseUrl() {
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    return ''
  }
  if (process.env.VERCEL_URL) {
    return `https://${process.env.VERCEL_URL}`
  }
  return `http://localhost:${process.env.PORT ?? 3000}`
}

export const api = createTRPCNext<AppRouter>({
  config() {
    return {
      links: [
        httpBatchLink({ url: getBaseUrl() + '/api' })
      ]
    }
  },
  ssr: false
})

export default function Index() {
  return (
    <>
      <Hello />
    </>
  )
}
```

Lastly, import `api` from `src/pages/index.tsx` and pass `MyApp` to the `withTRPC()` higher-order component.

```tsx
// src/pages/_app.tsx

import type { AppType } from 'next/app'
import { api } from './index'

const MyApp: AppType = ({ Component, pageProps }) => {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}

export default api.withTRPC(MyApp)
```

Open [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000/).

### Deploy to Vercel

TypeScript decided to [yuck my yum](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Yuck%20my%20yums.) at the last minute and gave the following error:

> Type error: The inferred type of `api` cannot be named without a reference to `.pnpm/@trpc+react-query@10.14.1_ldv44zvqpibs4fctxfwnszfeji/node_modules/@trpc/react-query/shared`. This is likely not portable. A type annotation is necessary.

This blog post is already long enough so instead of doing the responsible thing and fixing this error I'm going to [turn off TypeScript build errors](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/ignoring-typescript-errors) with a `next.config.js` file.

```bash
echo >> next.config.js
```

Set `ignoreBuildErrors` to `true` and prepare an apology tweet for the thousands of developers you just infuriated.

```js
// next.config.js

module.exports = {
  typescript: {
    ignoreBuildErrors: true,
  },
}
```

Install the `vercel` CLI as a project dependency and build your project's output. Then deploy to staging with the `--prebuilt` option and finally deploy to production with the `--prod` option.

```bash
pnpm add -D vercel
pnpm vercel build
pnpm vercel --prebuilt
pnpm vercel deploy --prod
```

Open [`ajcwebdev-trpc.vercel.app`](https://ajcwebdev-trpc.vercel.app/) to see your deployed app and run the following curl command to send a request to your `api` handler.

```bash
curl "https://ajcwebdev-trpc.vercel.app/api/hello?batch=1&input=%7B%220%22%3A%7B%22name%22%3A%22Next.js%20Edge%22%7D%7D"
```

If you followed along correctly and everything worked as intended you should get the following output:

```json
[
  {
    "result":{
      "data":{"text":"hello from Next.js Edge"}
    }
  }
]
```
