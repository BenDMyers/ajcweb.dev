## Introduction

[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) can be used to automate, customize, and execute software development workflows from within a GitHub repository. You can discover, create, and share actions to perform CI/CD jobs and combine actions in a customized workflow.

## Create an Action

We will create a boilerplate workflow to help you get started with Actions.

```bash
mkdir -p ajcwebdev-actions/.github/workflows
cd ajcwebdev-actions
echo > .github/workflows/hello.yml
echo '.DS_Store' > .gitignore
```

`on` controls when the workflow will run. `push` and `pull_request` events trigger the workflow but only for the main branch. `workflow_dispatch` allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab.

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:
```

A workflow run is made up of one or more `jobs` that can run sequentially or in parallel. Our workflow contains a single job called `build` that is running on `ubuntu-latest`.

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

`steps` represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job. `uses` checks-out your repository under `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`, so your job can access it. `run` will run a single command (`echo "Hello from GitHub Actions"`) which will print `Hello from GitHub Actions` using the runner's shell.

```yaml
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo "Hello from GitHub Actions"
```

The action will then run a multi-line script to print a series of messages containing common environment variables such as the repository name and job status.

```yaml
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo "Job was triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
          echo "Job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted on GitHub."
          echo "The branch name is ${{ github.ref }}."
          echo "The repository name is ${{ github.repository }}."
          echo "Job status is ${{ job.status }}."
```

### Complete GitHub Action

```yaml
# .github/workflows/hello.yml

name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo "Hello from GitHub Actions"
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo "Job was triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
          echo "Job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted on GitHub."
          echo "The branch name is ${{ github.ref }}."
          echo "The repository name is ${{ github.repository }}."
          echo "Job status is ${{ job.status }}."
```

## Push your project to a GitHub repository

Initialize the repository, add all changes to the staging area, and commit all staged changes.

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Action Jackson"
```

### Create a new blank repository

You can create a blank repository by visiting [repo.new](https://repo.new) or using the [`gh repo create`](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_repo_create) command with the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/). Enter the following command to create a new repository, set the remote name from the current directory, and push the project to the newly created repository.

```bash
gh repo create ajcwebdev-actions \
  --public \
  --source=. \
  --description="An Example GitHub Action Project" \
  --remote=upstream \
  --push
```

If you created a repository from the GitHub website instead of the CLI then you will need to set the remote and push the project with the following commands.

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/ajcwebdev/ajcwebdev-actions.git
git push -u origin main
```

Go to the [actions](https://github.com/ajcwebdev/ajcwebdev-actions/actions) tab on your GitHub repository to see your action.
