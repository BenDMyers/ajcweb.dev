## Hello World

Following is an example blog post written in an md file. You can find me @ src/pages/posts/hello-world.md. Here you can add/update/delete details and watch the changes live when running in develop mode.

## Using Markdown Elements

Here we have a JavaScript code block.

```js
let string = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
```

This is styled by Shiki, set via the [config](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#syntax-highlighting) for Astro. You can choose your own theme from this [library](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/blob/main/docs/themes.md#all-themes), which is currently set to Dracula, in the file `astro.config.mjs`.
