## Introduction

> Astro Theme Cactus is a simple, opinionated starter built with the Astro framework. Use it to create an easy-to-use blog or website. You can view a [live demo](https://astro-theme-cactus.netlify.app/) hosted on Netlify with the original starter project. Made with Astro, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and MDX.
