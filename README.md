## Introduction

> Astro Theme Cactus is a simple, opinionated starter built with the Astro framework. Use it to create an easy-to-use blog or website. You can view a [live demo](https://astro-theme-cactus.netlify.app/) hosted on Netlify with the original starter project. Made with Astro, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and MDX, the starter includes the following features:

- [Astro Image](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/image/) integration for optimized images
- [MDX posts](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) and pagination
- Theming color modes with [Tailwind](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/tailwind/) and [CSS variables](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/styling/#css-variables)
- [Shiki](https://shiki.matsu.io/) code syntax styling
- Auto-generated [sitemap](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/sitemap/)
