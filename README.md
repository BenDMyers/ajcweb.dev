## Introduction

> Astro Theme Cactus is a simple, opinionated starter built with the Astro framework. Use it to create an easy-to-use blog or website. You can view a [live demo](https://astro-theme-cactus.netlify.app/) hosted on Netlify with the original starter project. Made with Astro, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and MDX.

## Deploy

[Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/) has a great section and breakdown of how to deploy your own Astro site on various platforms and their idiosyncrasies. By default the site will be built (see Commands section above) to a `/dist` directory.

### Cloudflare

Site is deployed on Cloudflare Pages and uses [Cloudflare Redirects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/redirects/).
